## 📌 Examples

```batch
:: Open a GitHub profile
github.bat --profile exampleuser

:: Open a specific GitHub repository
github.bat --repo example-repo

## 🧠 How It Works

CMD Tools processes command-line flags and executes corresponding logic:
- `--profile` opens a GitHub user profile.
- `--repo` navigates to a repository page.
- Default behavior can open a homepage or show help text.
- Easily extensible to add more flags or services.
