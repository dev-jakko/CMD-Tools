# CMD-Tools

**CMD Tools** is a custom-made, user-friendly command-line tool designed to automate repetitive tasks and simplify everyday workflows by leveraging the power of batch scripting. Built to operate within a command-line environment, CMD Tools allows users to execute specific actions with just a few commands, saving time and increasing productivity.

The tool is ideal for developers, system administrators, and power users who are comfortable working within the terminal. Its core purpose is to streamline tasks that would otherwise require opening a web browser, navigating through complex interfaces, or interacting with multiple sites manually.

## Key Features of CMD Tools:
1. **Web Navigation Automation:** One of the primary features of CMD Tools is its ability to quickly open specific web pages from the terminal. Whether it’s a user profile, repository, or a particular page, the tool allows you to specify the destination by simply using commands like --profile, --repo, or others. For example, instead of manually typing a long URL, you can use the tool to instantly open the desired web page.
2. **Cross-Site Support:** Initially, CMD Tools provides support for popular platforms like GitHub. This makes it ideal for users who frequently interact with these sites and want to streamline their workflow. The tool can be easily extended to support more websites, allowing for limitless possibilities in web automation.
3. **Command-Line Flexibility:** CMD Tools is fully flexible, allowing users to pass in different arguments to control the behavior of the script. You can quickly customize the tool’s functionality by specifying flags such as -h for instructions, --profile to open a user profile, or --repo to open a repository page.
4. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks:** By providing predefined commands for common tasks (e.g., opening a GitHub profile or checking a repository), CMD Tools automates mundane tasks. This allows you to focus on more important work without needing to manually perform these actions each time.
5. **Modular and Expandable:** The tool is built to be modular and extensible. As your needs grow or if you want to interact with new websites, you can easily add new scripts or features to the tool. It also supports integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it a valuable addition to automated workflows.
6. **Simple Setup and Execution:** CMD Tools uses batch scripting, which is easy to configure and run on Windows systems. With just a few simple commands, users can start automating tasks right from the command line, without the need for a complex setup.

### Examples of Use:
1. Open GitHub Profile: With CMD Tools, you can open a specific GitHub profile using:
```batch
github.bat --profile exampleuser
```
2. Navigate to a GitHub Repository: Similarly, opening a repository is as simple as:
```batch
github.bat --repo example-repo
```

### How It Works:
CMD Tools works by processing command-line inputs through a set of batch scripts. When executed, the tool checks the flags and arguments provided by the user and opens the corresponding website or profile in the default web browser.
- If no arguments are provided, the script may open a default homepage.
- The --profile flag is used to open a user profile page, while the --repo flag opens a repository or project page on a specific website.
- Additional flags or arguments can be easily incorporated to add more functionality or handle more complex tasks, ensuring flexibility and customization.

### Benefits of CMD Tools:
- **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive web tasks, saving time and reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Productivity Boost:** With fewer steps to complete a task, users can be more productive and spend less time navigating through websites.
- **Ease of Use:** Designed to be user-friendly for those familiar with the command line, the tool is simple to use with minimal configuration.
- **Extensibility:** Users can expand the functionality of the tool to support additional websites and services as needed.

### Future Potential:

While CMD Tools currently only supports GitHub, its modular nature allows for continuous growth. Future versions can add more supported platforms, handle more complex tasks (such as interacting with APIs or scraping data), or even integrate with desktop applications for further automation.


### Who Can Benefit from CMD Tools?
- Developers: Quickly access user profiles, repositories, and documentation without leaving the terminal.
- System Administrators: Automate daily web-based tasks like monitoring profiles or checking repositories for updates.
- Social Media Managers: Easily open and view social media profiles for various platforms directly from the command line.
- Power Users: Anyone looking to automate web navigation and reduce the number of manual steps in their workflow.

## Installation Guide

To get started with CMD Tools, follow the steps below to install and configure the tool on your system. This guide assumes you are using a Windows environment, as the tools are written using batch scripts (.bat files).

### Prerequisites
- Windows Operating System (Since the tool relies on .bat files, it is specifically designed for Windows)
- A text editor for editing batch files (e.g., Notepad or VS Code)
- A web browser (the scripts will open URLs in your default browser)

### Installation Steps
1. Download the Repository:

    First, clone or download the repository that contains the CMD Tools. You can either use Git to clone it or download it as a ZIP file.

    - Clone via Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmd-tools.git
    ```

    - Download ZIP:

        - Navigate to the GitHub repository page.
        - Click on the Code button.
        - Select Download ZIP and extract it to a directory on your local machine.

2. Verify Batch File Permissions:

    Make sure that your batch files are executable. In most cases, batch files should already have execution permission, but if you encounter any issues, you can check the file properties and ensure there are no restrictions.
    - Right-click the batch file.
    - Select Properties.
    - Ensure there are no block or restriction options enabled under the General tab.

3. Add the Folder to the System Environment Variables `(PATH)`:

    To ensure you can call the CMD Tools from any command line window, add the directory to your system's PATH.
    - Open Start, search for "Environment Variables", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
    - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
    - Under System variables, scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click Edit.
    - Click New and add the full path to the CMD Tools directory (e.g., C:\path\to\cmd-tools).
    - Click OK to save the changes.
    - Restart any open Command Prompt windows for the changes to take effect

4. Run the Batch Scripts:

    After installation, you can run the batch files directly from the command line.
    - To run the github.bat script, simply type:
    ```bash
    github --profile exampleuser
    ```
    This will open the specified GitHub profile in your default browser.
